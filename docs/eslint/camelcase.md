# camelcase

    "camelcase": 2

Combining multiple styles together is a source of
frustration in having to remember what the property names
are.

JavaScript does not have a good auto complete so knowing
what the casing of a property is makes working with
JavaScript easier.

We should enforce camelcase. For the few use cases where you
need to access keys on JSON blobs coming from an external
process that has snake case you can use an exclude
statement.
