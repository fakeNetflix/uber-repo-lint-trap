# complexity

    "complexity": [1, 10]

Default cyclomatic complexity is 11, but it is only a
warning. Cyclomatic complexity is not something that should
be enforced per se but it's a great guideline to prompt the
application developer to either break his code into smaller
functions or add an exclusion comment.
