# global-strict

    "global-strict": [2, "always"]

The way commonJS works is that it wraps your file in a
function expression. This means that something which looks
like a global strict statement is actually isolated by a
function expression.

This means that the globalstrict bug is actually impossible
and should not be an error.

Strict mode also causes modifications to objects frozen with
`Object.freeze` to throw TypeErrors, which is desirable.
