# globals

    "globals": {
        "__dirname": true,
        "__filename": true,
        "require": true,
        "module": true
    },

This is the minimum set of globals required both in the
browser and in NodeJS. Restricting globals to this set has
numerous benefits:

 - It trains developers to never rely on global scope
 - It reduces the length of the scope chain that needs to be
   traversed since pointers to a global object are 
   encountered sooner in the chain.
 - Allows globals to be mocked in testing environments.

The only whitelisted globals are `__dirname`, `__filename`,
`module` and `require`. The former two are the only globals
that cannot be provided by the module system and the latter
two are the only ones needed in order to use the module
system.

`exports` is not whitelisted. You should instead always
access `exports` via a property on `module`. e.g.
`module.exports = someObject;`

For other globals such as `process`, `global`, `window`,
`document`, you should include the following two modules in
your project if needed.

* [raynos/global][raynos-global] => `global`, `window` and `document`
* [defunctzombie/node-process][defunctzombie-node-process] => `process`

If you want any other globals you can require them. i.e.

* `require('timers').setTimeout;`
* `require('timers').clearTimeout;`
* `require('timers').setInterval;`
* `require('timers').clearInterval;`
* `require('buffer').Buffer;`
* `require('process');`
* `require('global');`
* `require('console');`
