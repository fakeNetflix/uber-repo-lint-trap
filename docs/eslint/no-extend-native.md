    "no-extend-native": 2

Extending native prototype or mutating them in any way is
banned. Native prototype mutation is a terrible idea and
breaks the npm modularity system by running into name
collisions.

If there are certain ES6 features you want polyfilled such
as [`Array.prototype.find()`][array-prototype-find], you
should use correctly written polyfills such as those written
by [Paul Miller][paulmillr].

Below is a list of well-written polyfills. Feel free to add
to this list, but please only add polyfills, whose code you
have actually investigated so we can guarantee
quality/correctness here.

* [Array.prototype.find() Polyfill][array-prototype-find-polyfill]
* [Array.prototype.findIndex() Polyfill][array-prototype-find-index-polyfill]
