# disallowEmptyBlocks

    "disallowEmptyBlocks": true

Missing blocks are either a sign that a developer intended
to do something, but forgot to implement it or its a sign
that a developer is not following the [YAGNI][yagni] rule.
The only case where it's appropriate to have an empty block
is `function noop() {};`. Empty blocks are generally bad.
Especially if you have an empty catch block.
