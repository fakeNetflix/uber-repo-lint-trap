# disallowKeywords

    "disallowKeywords": [
        "with",
        "try",
        "catch",
        "finally"
    ]

The `with` keyword is generally [considered harmful][with-
considered-harmful], although there are a few extreme cases
where it might be useful. [1][with1] [2][with2]. Also,
`with` is banned in strict mode and thus banned in JSCS.

In JavaScript, and especially NodeJS, you should only ever
throw an error when a programmer has made and error (i.e. a
bug). As such, `try`, `catch`, `finally` are also banned. In
JavaScript one should not use try catch for control flow.
For operational errors, the error should be returned to the
callee, who can then determine how to handle it.

The only exception where `try`/`catch`/`finally` are
unavoidable (only because it is too late to go back and
change history) is using `JSON.parse` with malformed JSON or
`JSON.stringify` on an object with circular dependencies.

In the case of parsing and stringifying JSON, we recommend
that you use the [raynos/safe-json-parse][safe-json-parse].
If you are parsing after reading a JSON file or stringifying
before writing a JSON file, you may want to use the
[jprichardson/node-jsonfile][jsonfile] module to simplify
things further.

If you find yourself using a library that is throwing on
anything other than programmer errors (logic errors), then
it is a good sign that that library is poorly written and
you should be using something else.
