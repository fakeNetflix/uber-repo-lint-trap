# disallowMultipleLineBreaks

    "disallowMultipleLineBreaks": true

If you require multiple line breaks (beyond one empty line),
it is almost always an extra unnecessary line or a sign that
you should include comments to explain in words why two
sections are different. Whitespace alone conveys that one
thing is separate from another, but does not convery *why*.
