# disallowMultipleVarDecl

    "disallowMultipleVarDecl": true

Var statements should be one per line. This rule enforces
consistency and eliminates a source of runtime bugs when a
comma-separated variable declaration list is modified,
resulting in a missing comma or extraneous comma. This makes
variable declarations easier to move around and refactor
without messing around with commas and semicolons.
