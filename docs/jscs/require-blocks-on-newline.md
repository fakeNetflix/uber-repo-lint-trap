# requireBlocksOnNewline

    "requireBlocksOnNewline": true

This improves readability in 99% of cases. If your going to
use a block then use a new line. putting a block in a single
line encourages terse and unreadable code.Pretty much the
only case in which readability is reduced is single-line
`if` statements, and even then some will argue that `if`
statements with only one line in its block is more readable
with newlines.
