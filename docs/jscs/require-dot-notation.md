# requireDotNotation

    "requireDotNotation": true

Property access should be consistent. All objects should be
accessed via dot notation unless the object key cannot be
expressed in dot notation. This makes code more readable and
maximally minifiable. The only legitimate reason to revisit
this rule is to allow us to use Google's Closure Compiler in
advanced compression mode.
