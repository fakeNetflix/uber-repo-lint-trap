# validateIndentation

    "validateIndentation": 4

While the default value is 4, this rule is dynamically
generated based on the indentation style already used in a
project.

**We may want to re-evaluate** this in the near future.
Raynos recommends that we change to 8 spaces. 8 spaces
forces you to allocated and abuse closures willy nilly. It
also forces you to break nested functions out into function
declarations.

Making it harder to write messy code raises the average code
quality. Making it harder to write closures removes memory
leaks from real production code.
