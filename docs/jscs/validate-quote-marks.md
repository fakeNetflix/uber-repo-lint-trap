# validateQuoteMarks

    "validateQuoteMarks": {
        "mark": "'",
        "escape": true
    }

We should have consistent quote marks. Mixing the two causes
overhead and confusion. All strings should use single
quotes, however double quotes are allowed only in cases
where the string contains single quotes and the developer
would like to avoid having to escape them. The goal is
consistency with an exception made for readability.
